# Pusheen!
Pics for the app Pusheen!

## Github Steps:
1. Find a pic you like that isn't on the app.
2. Fork the repositiory
3. Name the pic DD-MM-YY-username and add it to the "Request" folder EX: 15-09-17-sduong25.
5. Create a push request
4. When I have the time I will add it to the app!

*Or if you fould a link to the image or have a direct link, post a text file (.txt, .md, etc.) place it in the Request folder w/ the same DD-MM-YY-username format.*

## Google Drive Folder
If you are not smart or tech savy enough to understand how to use Github (You should though if you ever want to do open sourse thingies), I have created a Google Drive folder (I wouldn't recommend this, because someone can take your images, delete them, etc.)

**If Emailing, Please set the subject to "Pusheen-DD-MM-YY-name_to_go_by" (Don't put _'s) EX: 15-09-17-john**
